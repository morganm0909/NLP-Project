Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It enables computers to read, understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning, deep learning, and statistical models to process text and speech data. 

One of the key applications of NLP is machine translation, which allows people to translate text between different languages automatically. Another important use case is sentiment analysis, where businesses analyze customer feedback to determine whether it is positive, neutral, or negative. NLP is also used in chatbots, speech recognition, and text summarization, which helps in extracting key insights from large volumes of text.

Despite its advancements, NLP faces challenges such as understanding context, sarcasm, and different linguistic structures. The ambiguity of human language makes it difficult for AI models to always produce accurate results. However, with ongoing research and improvements in deep learning, NLP continues to evolve and power intelligent applications across industries.
